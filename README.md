# Dark Mode Toggle ðŸŒŒ

After seeing the animation when toggling Dark Theme in Slack, I thought I'd try my hand at replicating the animation. After that I wondered how I could spice up the animation by using a circular reveal.

## Linear Reveal

The new view is revealed top to bottom.

## Circular Reveal

The new view is animated out by an ever increasing circular mask, from a center point.
